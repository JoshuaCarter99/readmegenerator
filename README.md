# Read Me Generator

## Description

- My motivation towards completing this project was in wanting to use my familiarity with Node, and my new found knowledge in package.json AND index.js in conjunction to create an application.
- I built this project to display what I have learned about Node, .JSON, and new JS methods throughout my school's most recent module.
- The problem solved within the challenge was building a functioning README Generator that utilized a "Node" response instead of building it into a standard HTML webpage.
- I learned how to build a functional app that utilized Node, .JSON, and JS.

## Installation

1. Created repository on GitHub.com and cloned repository locally to desktop.
2. Created index.js and a generateMarkdown.js first to make sure both were working in conjunction.
3. Created a package.json and a package-lock.json to hold project's metadata.
4. Created git ignore and license files.
5. Pushed local changes back to main branch on original GitHub repository (via GitHub.com), and deployed code at live URL (after testing project)


## Usage

Generate a README! Install Node, install Git Bash, and git clone repo link to use README Generator. Open gitbash after installing all of the above and open repo's main branch through Git Bash. Run "node index.js" through the gitbash command terminal and certain questions will be asked that you can type responses to (What is the application's intended use, how to install, title, etc.). After, a newREADME.md will pop up in the repo's files and you can view your newly generated README!
